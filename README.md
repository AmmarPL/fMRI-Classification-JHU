# fMRI-Classification-JHU
Our project to classify resting state fMRI brain networks using deep learning. The dataset was processed using group-ICA and dual regression.

The model weights can be found in [this link](https://livejohnshopkins-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/apallik1_jh_edu/Eqo4DojG33pBquC3_zCNYhYBSTcUS6Ppfhl9OAVF_erlZQ?e=bfn0E7)

The rgb_images folder contains 100 rgb images and their labels in labels.csv. The brain network name corresponding to a label number can be found in ClusterNames.csv.
